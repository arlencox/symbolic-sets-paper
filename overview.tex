\section{Overview}
\label{s:2:over}
In this section, we present two static analyses that make use of set
reasoning in order to compute high level semantic properties of
programs.
These analyses rely on abstract interpretation~\cite{cc:popl:77} and
on an abstraction of program states, that describes data structures
and their contents.
An abstract domain defines a set of predicates that an analysis may
use, as well as operators to over-approximate the effect of program
behaviors on these predicates, and their implementation.

\paragraph{Inferrence of properties of open objects.}
Dynamic programming languages such as JavaScript feature {\em open objects}
that support dynamic addition and deletion of attributes and iteration over
them.
The analysis presented in~\cite{hoo:14:sas} verifies
open-object-/map-manipulating programs such as the one
in Figure~\ref{f:1:intro}, by
inferring relations between the sets of attributes
of distinct objects.
Since objects may have an unbounded number of attributes, the analysis must 
abstract the attributes and their contents.

Figure~\ref{f:2:hoo} represents a simplified state at the indicated
point in Figure~\ref{f:1:intro}(a),
after two iterations (thus two fields were copied).
We focus on the set of attributes of each object, and ignore their
contents (which could be described using similar techniques).
To precisely abstract the relations between the attributes of both objects
(\eg copied attributes are common to both objects), we partition the
attributes into a series of attribute sets,
and express relations among these sets.
The purpose of the set abstract domain is to represent such set
relations.
The right hand side of Figure~\ref{f:2:hoo} depicts such an abstract
state, where \( X_n, X_r, X_v \) stand for sets of attributes, which are
made explicit, in the case of the left hand side concrete state.

Moreover, to infer these invariants, the analysis needs to reason
about both object structures and attributes sets.
Initially, it assumes no set relation, and the fields of
each object should be associated to an arbitrary set of attributes.
When the analysis enters the body of the loop, it needs to
{\em single out} attribute \( \mathtt{x} \), thus, to replace set
\( X_v \) by \( X_v \suplus \{ \mathtt{x} \} \) (which produces the
equalities of Figure~\ref{f:2:hoo}).
When it exits the loop, the analysis should {\em generalize}
both the object and set constraints abstractions, which requires
{\em eliminating} the singleton \( \{ \mathtt{x} \} \) from the
equations (it is visible only in the loop body) and synthesizing
a new, more general collection of constraints.
To allow these steps, the set abstraction should provide basic operations
over set predicates, including (1) the addition of a set constraint, (2)
the proving of a set constraint, (3) the removal of a set variable and
(4) the generalization of two set abstract states.

\paragraph{Shape analysis in presence of unstructured sharing.}
The shape analysis for data-structures with unbounded sharing presented
in~\cite{memcad:15:sas} relies on separation logic~\cite{r:lics:02} to
describe memory states and on inductive definitions to summarize
unbounded structures such as lists.
Unstructured sharing is very challenging as it cannot be described using
conventional inductive definitions.
Figure~\ref{f:3:memcad}(a) displays the representation of a three nodes
graph using an adjacency list data-structure.
To summarize such a structure using inductive predicates in separation
logic, \cite{memcad:15:sas} augments the list inductive
predicates with set information, which express where edges may point to.
Figure~\ref{f:3:memcad}(b) shows this representation in
a form where the first node is kept materialized.
It asserts that the edges of that node and other nodes
point to the address of a valid node, namely an element of \( \{ \naddr{0}
\} \suplus \mcE \).

  \caption{Summarization of an adjacency list-based graph representation}
  \label{f:3:memcad}
\end{figure}
The analysis of~\cite{memcad:15:sas} introduces a summary predicate
\( \textbf{graph}( \naddr{0}, \mcN ) \) where \( \naddr{0} \) is the
address of the first node and \( \mcN \) the set of all node addresses.
This predicate is defined by induction over the ``backbone'' of the
structure, and fully takes into account the property that all
\( \fldnext \) edges point to a valid node address in \( \mcN \).
Henceforth, abstract states comprise both a {\em memory} part (which
consists of a formula in separation logic with inductive predicates)
and a {\em set abstraction}.

To compute such summaries, the analysis needs to perform similar
operations as the analysis for open objects, in order to add set
constraints to the set abstract state, prove set constraints,
remove set variables and generalize abstract states.
