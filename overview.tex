\section{Overview}
\label{s:2:over}
%-> a couple of examples, showing very intuitively (possibly just with pictures)
%the need for set abstractions
%Possibly:
%- a quick picture of HOO
%- a quick picture of Huisong's work

\paragraph{Abstract domains in static analysis.} % remove par mark if useless
%   . quick definition
%   . role of the section: examplify need for set abstract domains, in
%     informal terms

\paragraph{Inferrence of open objects properties.}
%   . main features of open objects
%   . static analysis task: infer relation between object sets of fields
%   . abstraction of structures
%   . role of the set abstraction
%   . nature of the invariants that are inferred
\cite{hoo:14:sas}

\paragraph{Shape analysis in presence of unstructured sharing.}
% - paragraph on MemCAD
%   . sharing properties, and inductive definitions parametered with sets
%   . static analysis tasks: infer summaries, with appropriate set parameters
%   . abstract domain structure
%   . role of the set abstraction
\cite{memcad:15:sas}

\paragraph{Need for set reasoning.}
%   . a "master domain" controls the shape of properties
%   . set abstraction not specific, simply represents the facts sent by
%     the "master domain".
