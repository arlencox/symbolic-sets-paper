  When constructing complex program analyses, it is often useful to
  reason about not just individual values, but collections of values.
  Symbolic set abstractions provide building blocks that can be used
  to partition elements, relate partitions to other partitions, and
  determine the provenance of multiple values, all without knowing
  any concrete values.
  To address the simultaneous challenges of scalability and precision,
  we formalize and implement an interface for symbolic set abstractions
  and construct multiple abstract domains relying on both specialized data
  structures and off-the-shelf theorem provers.
  We develop techniques for lifting existing domains to improve performance
  and precision.
  We evaluate these domains on real-world data structure analysis problems.
 
%  Software static analysis tools often need to perform set reasoning in
%  order to track sets of program values, pointers and memory addresses.
%  Relations among sets and elements need to be tracked during the analysis
%  to enable the verification of some classes of program semantic properties.
%  We formalize an {\em abstract domain view} of set reasoning, in the sense
%  of abstract interpretation, which integrates naturally into interpretation
%  based static analyzers.
%  We construct basic set abstract domains relying on efficient specialized
%  data-structures and propose techniques to lift set abstract domains into
%  more expressive or more efficient ones.
%  We also show that readily available solvers can be turned into set
%  abstract domains.
%  We report on the design and implementation of QUICr, a library of set
%  abstract domains and assess the efficiency and precision of domains
%  built from specialized structures and solvers.
