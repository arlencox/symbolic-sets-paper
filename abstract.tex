  When constructing complex program analyses, it is often useful to be able to reason about not just individual values, but collections of values.  Symbolic set abstractions provide such a building block that can be use to construct partitions of elements, relate partitions to other partitions, determine the provenance of multiple values, all without knowing any concrete values.  Guided by the scalability problems of prior set abstractions, we extended the QUICr set abstract domain library with new domains designed to simultaneously address scalability and precision problems.  We evaluate these new domains on real-world data structure analysis problems.
 
%  Software static analysis tools often need to perform set reasoning in
%  order to track sets of program values, pointers and memory addresses.
%  Relations among sets and elements need to be tracked during the analysis
%  to enable the verification of some classes of program semantic properties.
%  We formalize an {\em abstract domain view} of set reasoning, in the sense
%  of abstract interpretation, which integrates naturally into interpretation
%  based static analyzers.
%  We construct basic set abstract domains relying on efficient specialized
%  data-structures and propose techniques to lift set abstract domains into
%  more expressive or more efficient ones.
%  We also show that readily available solvers can be turned into set
%  abstract domains.
%  We report on the design and implementation of QUICr, a library of set
%  abstract domains and assess the efficiency and precision of domains
%  built from specialized structures and solvers.
